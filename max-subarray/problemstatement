Given an array A={a1,a2,â€¦,aN} of N elements, find the maximum possible sum of a

Contiguous subarray
Non-contiguous (not necessarily contiguous) subarray.
Empty subarrays/subsequences should not be considered.

This Youtube video by Ben Wright might be useful to understand the Kadane algorithm for the maximum subarray in a 1-D sequence.
